# a2-sys-ml-meetup
principles, motivations and marketing

## Motivation

I really just want a "hacker" atmosphere. I think I'll focus mostly on systems and ML. I think it'll be a mix of research, personal projects and speeches. I want it to be an atmosphere where a conversation(maybe mulitple) can start and anyone can show their stuff off. Tech for the sake of tech. No Agile EVER. No fixation on large orgs (digital transformation, cloud fixation, methodologies). MAYBE Startups. Badass shit. Modern tooling like Rust. SOTA databases, ML systems, compute, static analysis. Heavy engineering focus. Frontend only if there was interesting ENGINEERING (on the order of diff -> signal algorithms in implementation of frontend frameworks)

## Content

Very open to begin with. I'll need to measure what people want during the first meeting. I really want an open discussion. Maybe we can partition by interests? Networking could eventually be mixed in as there are a few tech companies and the local college.

## Venue / Time

Somewhere in Downtown Ann Arbor at an accessible time: AADL, 11am Saturday

## Marketing:

Need to measure and execute campaigns on Reddit, Facebook, Meetup, EventBrite and Email. Measure clicks on these via UTM + GA4. 

UTMS (use utm_content to A/B test newsletter variations + flyer locations):
- newsletter: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=target_date&utm_content=default
- flyer: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=physical&utm_campaign=target_date&utm_content=default
- reddit: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social_media&utm_campaign=target_date
- facebook: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social_media&utm_campaign=target_date
- eventbrite: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_medium=meetup_platform&utm_campaign=target_date
- meetup: https://www.a2sysml.xyz?utm_source=meetup&utm_medium=meetup_platform&utm_campaign=target_date

## Feedback

Feedback can be gathered through a form accessible on the website.

## Engagement

We will use email for weekly newsletters/announcements and Slack for topic specific communication.

## Next Steps

Looking to meet Saturday, December 30th, 2023.

TODO:
- Design flyers (logo /w text, qr code to website (make sure this has UTM for tracking), blurb describing goals/first meeting setting, use photoshop or some other free software)
- Put forms, complete website (check for any glaring issues, add parking/transit instructions (with map))
- Write promotions on EventBrite, Meetup, Reddit, Facebook w/ UTM links for understanding where time needs to be invested in.
- Advertise + write first newsletter (keep this simple, use markdown, include parking/transit instructions)
