principles, motivations and marketing


## first thoughts

dump from conversation with chatgpt

1 Focus/Goals: I really just want a "hacker" atmosphere. I think I'll focus mostly on systems. I think it'll be a mix of research, personal projects and speeches. I want it to be an atmosphere where a conversation(maybe mulitple) can start and anyone can show their stuff off. Tech for the sake of tech. No Agile EVER. No fixation on large orgs (digital transformation, cloud fixation, methodologies). MAYBE Startups. Badass shit. Modern tooling like Rust. SOTA databases, ML systems, compute, static analysis. Heavy engineering focus. Frontend only if there was interesting ENGINEERING (on the order of diff -> signal algorithms in implementation of frontend frameworks).
2 Venue: I found cheap or free indoor vanues. I'll try and prioritize spots downtown, so we can get Jerusalem Garden afterwards (this means Sunday is off the table).
3 Date/Time: I want this to a weekly meetup (maybe biweekly). I think for the first meetup, I'll do Saturday morning (maybe 10am?)
4 Promotion: I'll do a mix of all platforms you listed, and Reddit. I'll make a promotional website. Flyers would be cool too (where to distribute them?).
5 Content/Format: Very open to begin with.
6 Networking/Colab: I'll have to work this in. The local college and tech companies are decent.
7 Feedback: I'll get feedback a variety of ways- I want to continuously gather feedback. I'd like a mobile accessible website where users can scan a qr code to get to, so they can put feedback in real time or anytime.
8/9: Irrelevant
10 Engagement: I wonder what platforms I can talk with everyone though. I was thinking of using email for weekly newsletters and Slack for topic specific chats

TODO:
- Design/Implement Website (qr, hacker theme (is this cringe or non-approachable)
- Design flyers
- Setup promotion on EventBrite, Meetup, Reddit, Facebook
- Find room
- Find people
